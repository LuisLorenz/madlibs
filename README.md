# madlibs

starting off, this should be my first real project that will be commited to github 

# principle
the user gets asked to insert certain words for a specific var 
but the user does not know on which spot the var are placed
as a result the var create a funny text in context 

# basic code 
input()
var = ... 
print()

# variation
the computer chooses a random word of a list which becomes the value for one of the given variables 
so with this random mode always a new madlibs is created
